# Project Agape

This is an ASP.NET Web App developed to supply the Borrowed Hearts Foundation with an interface for their shoppers and volunteers to use.

## Description

Borrowed Hearts is a non-profit store where foster workers and children can shop for donated items to take home. Shoppers will use the application to submit a check-in form to the Borrowed Hearts database, and Volunteers will use the application as a timepunch system. An administrator can manage the database through a robust menu after logging in.
